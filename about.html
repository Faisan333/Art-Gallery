        <p>An art gallery is a room or a building in which visual art is displayed. In Western cultures from the mid-15th Century, a gallery was any long, narrow covered passage along a wall, first used in the sense of a place for art in the 1590s.</p><br>
        <p>The most common type of art gallery is the commercial art gallery. Although the word ‘commercial’ may have a negative connotation, as if they only care about the money, this is in fact the ‘best’ type of art gallery there is for artists or collectors,
            playing a crucial role in the art world. With commercial art galleries, the gallery collaborates with several artists, agreeing to represent and support them. This means the gallery commits to showcase, promote, sell and distribute the artworks
            of the artist in question. Doing so, the artist is able to make a living and build his career, collectors base and artist resume. In return, the gallery earns money on a commission basis with the sales of the artworks. Doing so, the gallery
            is motivated to do the best work possible for the artist, pushing their career and sales. A win-win! The gallery makes money, and so does the artist. The better the artists are promoted are grow their careers, the better the reputation of
            the gallery. In a nutshell, what is good for the artists is good for the gallery.</p>
